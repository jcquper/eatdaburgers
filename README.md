Hello, thank you for viewing my burger app assignment. I am excited to prepare a organized list of burger ideas for you to 'devour'. I apologize for doing the assignment very rushed I have had a very hectic few weeks but am excited to get back into the swing of things.

Eat-Da-Burger is a simple website that requires the user to insert a type of burger they enjoy into the textbox and click the 'get grillin' button to save it to the site. Every burger the user adds will stay on the screen in the order it was added until the user decides to 'devour' it. This second button shows up after the burger is listed right next to it.
